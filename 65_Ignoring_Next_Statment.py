# The following code prints Hello, check if 2 is greater than 1 and then breaks the loop because 2 is actuallygrater than 1. Therefore Hi is not printed out. Please replace break with something else so that Hello is printed out repeatedly.

# while True:
#     print("Hello")

#     if 2 > 1:
#         break
#     print("Hi")
