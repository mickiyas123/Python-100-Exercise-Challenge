# Expected output: 

# Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and to be part of reality as much as we are, even though we can never
# interact with them. The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observa
# ble universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater
# region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able
# to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that
# is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.
