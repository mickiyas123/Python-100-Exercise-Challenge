# Question: The script is supposed to print out letter "e" if the letter is in string "Hello", but it doesn't. Please try to fix the script.

# for letter in "Hello":
#     if letter == "e":
#     print(letter)


for letter in "Hello":
    if letter == "e":
     print(letter)
# there must be indentation after the if statment
