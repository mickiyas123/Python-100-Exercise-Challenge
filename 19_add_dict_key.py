# Question: Add a new pair of key (e.g. c ) and value (e.g. 3 ) to the dictionary and print out the new dictionary.

d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

# Expected output: 

#   {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2} 

d['c']=3

print(d)

# we can add key and value to a dict by writing thd dictionary then the key and assign it the value we want
